<h2>Background</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of his father was Jabal bin Amr and the name of his mother was Hind bint Sahl, who belonged to the Banu Raba‘ah branch of the Juhaynah tribe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Mu‘az </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal’s title was Abdur-Rahman and he belonged to the Uday bin Sa‘d bin Ali branch of the Khazraj tribe. The author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siyar-us-Sahabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [life of the companions] writes that Sa‘d bin Ali had two sons, Salama and Uday. Banu Salama is the progeny of Salama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the era of Islam, only two individuals from the progeny of Uday bin Sa‘d survived; they were Hazrat Mu‘az </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and his son, Abdur-Rahman. The houses of Banu Uday were situated in the neighbourhood of Banu Salama. Hazrat Mu‘az bin Jabal was of extremely fair complexion, had a beautiful countenance, bright teeth and beautiful eyes. Amongst his people, he was considered the most handsome, youthful and generous person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abu Nu‘aim relates that Hazrat Mu‘az </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal was more compassionate, modest and generous than any other youth of the Ansar. Hazrat Mu‘az </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal participated in the second pledge of initiation at Aqabah, along with 70 other Ansar and was 18 years old at the time of his acceptance of Islam. Hazrat Mu‘az </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal participated alongside the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in all the battles, including the battles of Badr, Uhud and Khandaq. When he participated in the Battle of Badr, he was 20 or 21 years of age. His step-brother (who was born to the same mother but had a different father) was Hazrat Abdullah </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jadd and he also participated in the Battle of Badr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usd-ul-Ghabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the name of his step-brother was Sahl bin Muhammad bin Jadd. Sahl belonged to Banu Salama, therefore they also counted him among their tribe. When the Muhajireen of Mecca migrated to Medina, the Holy Prophet </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> formed a bond of brotherhood between Hazrat Abdullah </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Mas‘ud and Hazrat Mu‘az </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal. This is the only reference that can be found in this regard from the various books of history.</span></p>
<h2>Acceptance of Islam</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After accepting Islam, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal, along with the youth of Banu Salama, broke the idols of their tribe. <small class="text-muted"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Ali Ibn al-Athir, </span></small></span><small class="text-muted"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usd-ul-Ghabah fi Ma‘rifat al-Sahabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 5, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 2003] 187) (Ibn </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa‘d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vol. 3, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal wa min Sa‘ir Bani Salamah [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 1990] 437-438) (Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Isabah fi Tamyiz al-Sahabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 6 [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 1995] 107-108) (Sheikh Shah Moinuddin Ahmad Nadvi, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siyar al-Sahabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 3, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal [Karachi, Pakistan: Dar al-Isha‘ah, 2004] 497)</span></span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Amr</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jamooh placed an idol made out of wood in his home. He named it Manaat and would show great respect to it and revere it. On the occasion of the second Bai‘at [pledge] at Aqabah, some youths from Banu Salama also pledged their allegiance. Among them was Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal and also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the son of Amr [bin Jamooh] who also pledged his allegiance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Amr</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jamooh’s son devised a plan to call his father towards Islam. He would take the idol of Hazrat Amr</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which he had placed in his home, and throw it into a pit or a pile of rubbish. Some of the youths would assist him in this, including Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal. Nevertheless, he threw the idol into the pit of rubbish one day. Amr</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found it, brought it back home and said, “If I come to know who is doing this to my idol, I will punish him severely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following day, these young men did the same with the idol and it was once again lying face down in the pit. He once again picked it up and brought it back. The third day, he cleaned the idol again and placed it in his home, but this time, he hung his sword around the idol and said, “By God! I am not aware of who is doing this to you, but I am leaving a sword with you so that you may protect yourself. You now have a sword.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following day, Hazrat Amr</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noticed that the idol was once again not in its place and found it in that very pit nearby, tied to the neck of a dead dog. Seeing this, he was taken aback and became extremely concerned and was compelled to ponder over the fact that the idol he considered to be a god and had placed in his home did not even have the strength and power to protect itself even with a sword by its side; how then could it possibly protect him? Furthermore, it was lying around the neck of a dead dog. Thus, he deeply reflected on how this could possibly be a god. Nevertheless, this incident was the cause for his inclination towards Islam and later accepting Islam. <small class="text-muted">(Ali Ibn al-Athir, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usd al-Ghabah fi Ma‘rifat al-Sahabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 4, Amr bin al-Jamuh [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 2003] 195)</span></small></p>
<h2>Love For the Holy Prophet(sa)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal’s love and devotion to the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can also be gauged by the fact that when the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> returned to Medina following the Battle of Uhud, sounds of wailing and lamenting could be heard in the streets. The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> asked what it was? They replied that these were the wives of the Ansar, who were weeping for their martyrs. Upon this, the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said, “Is there no one to weep for Hamza?” The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then prayed for the forgiveness of Hazrat Hamza</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa‘d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa‘d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Ubadah, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal and Hazrat Abdullah</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Rawahah heard this, they went to their respective neighbourhoods and gathered the women of Medina who were wailing and weeping. They then said, “No one shall now mourn over the martyrs of the Ansar until they have mourned over the uncle of the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because he said there is no one in Medina to mourn over Hazrat Hamza</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” This was their love and devotion to the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> upon seeing that he was in pain due to [the martyrdom of] Hazrat Hamza</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <small class="text-muted">(Ibn Hisham, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Raud al-Anf fi Tafsir al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vol. 3, Ghazwat Uhud [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 1986], 95-96)</span></small></p>
<h2>Lamenting in Islam</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although howling and shrieking over a departed one is forbidden, but the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> permitted it in this instance, or perhaps having witnessed the emotions of the people, he expressed his wish for them to also express their emotions for Hazrat Hamza</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But in any case, howling and shrieking over the dead is forbidden in Islam and the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> himself forbade it.</span></p>
<h2>Teacher of the Holy Quran</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the conquest of Mecca, the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> went to Hunain. Hunain is a valley situated north-east of Mecca, near Ta‘if. The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kept Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal in Mecca, so that he could teach the people of Mecca about Islam and the Holy Quran. <small class="text-muted">(Ibn </small></span><small class="text-muted"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa‘d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vol. 2, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal, [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-‘Ilmiyyah, 1990] 265) (Sayyid Fadl al-Rahman, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farhang-i-Sirat </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Karachi, Pakistan: Zawwar Academy Publications, 2003]</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 109)</span></small></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Musleh-e-Maud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has explained this Hadith. Hazrat Musleh-e-Maud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appointed a group of teachers who taught the Holy Quran; they [learned and] memorised the entire Holy Quran from the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and taught it to others. These were four esteemed teachers who were responsible for learning the Holy Quran from the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and teaching it to others and there were many companions under them who would also teach the Holy Quran to others. The names of these four esteemed teachers are Abdullah bin Mas‘ud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Salim</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the freed slave of Abu Huzaifah</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal and Ubayy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Ka</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. The first two were Muhajireen and the latter two were Ansar. With regard to their work, Abdullah</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Mas‘ud was a labourer, Salim</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a freed slave, while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal and Ubayy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Ka</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">b were chieftains of Medina. Thus, the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appointed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">qaris</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [reciters] keeping in view every member of society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is narrated in a Hadith that the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used to say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="quran arabic" style="font-weight: 400;">خُذُوا الْقُراٰنَ مِنْ اَرْبَعَۃٍ (مِنْ) عَبْدِاللّٰہِ بِنْ مَسْعُوْدٍ وَ سَالِمٍ وَ مُعَاذِ بِنْ جَبَلٍ وَاُبَیِّ بِنْ کَعْبٍ</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“‘Anyone who desires to read the Quran should learn from the following four individuals; Abdullah bin Mas‘ud, Salim, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal and Ubayy bin Ka</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">b.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These were the four people who either learned the entire Quran from the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or would recite it before him to ensure they did not make any mistakes. Aside from them, there were also many other companions who learned various portions of the Holy Quran directly from the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is related in another narration that on one occasion, when Hazrat Abdullah</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Mas‘ud [was reciting the Quran, he] pronounced a word differently. Hazrat Umar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stopped him and said that it should be pronounced in such and such manner. Hazrat Abdullah</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Mas‘ud stated that the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taught him to pronounce it in that very manner. Hazrat Umar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took him to the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and complained that he did not recite the Quran correctly. The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> asked Abdullah</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Mas‘ud to recite. When he recited it, the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said he was reciting correctly. Thereupon Hazrat Umar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> submitted, ‘O Messenger</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Allah, you taught me to pronounce the word differently.’ The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told him that that was also correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This shows that in addition to the four companions who learnt the Holy Quran from the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there were others who also used to learn portions of the Holy Quran from him.

<h2>Status In the Eyes of the Holy Prophet(sa)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Anas bin Malik</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relates that the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said, “From among my Ummah, the most merciful to them is Abu Bakr</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; the one who most strictly adheres to the religion of Allah is Umar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; the most modest is Uthman</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; the best decision-maker is Ali</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Abi Talib; the most knowledgeable of the Holy Quran is Ubayy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Ka</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">b; the most knowledgeable of what is lawful and unlawful is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal and the person with the greatest awareness of his obligations is Zaid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Thabit.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Abu Hurairah</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relates that the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said, “What an excellent man is Abu Bakr; what an excellent man is Umar; what an excellent man is Abu Ubaidah bin al-Jarrah; what an excellent man is Usaid bin Hudair; what an excellent man is Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas; what an excellent man is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal and what an excellent man is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Amr bin al-Jamooh.” This is a narration of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 7, p. 502, Hadith 9421, Alam al-Kutub, Beirut, 1998)</span></small></p>

The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> replied, “The most excellent form of faith is to instil love for Allah and to only express your hatred for His sake, and to remain occupied in the remembrance of Allah.” Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then asked, “O Messenger of Allah, what else?” The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> answered, “Love for others what you love for yourself.

<h2>Guidance on Reciting Shorter Surahs in Congregational Prayer</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Jabir bin Abdillah</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> narrates that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal would pray with the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and then return to his tribe and lead them in prayer. <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih al-Bukhari</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kitab al-Adhan, Bab idha Salla thumma amma Qauman, Hadith 711)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He would first come to Masjid al-Nabawi and offer prayers there, after which he would return to his home and lead his people in prayer. This is a narration from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih al-Bukhari</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Jabir</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> narrates that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would offer prayers with the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and then would return to his people and lead them in prayers. One evening, he offered the Isha prayer behind the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When he returned to his people, he led them in prayers and began reciting Surah al-Baqarah [chapter 2 of the Holy Quran]. Upon this, one person separated himself from the congregation, said ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">salaam</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ [to indicate the end of prayer] and began to pray on his own. When he saw that a lengthy chapter was being recited, he said ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">salaam</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ and began to offer the prayer on his own. Seeing him do this, the people called out his name and said, “Have you become a hypocrite?” They admonished him for leaving the congregational prayer and praying on his own and asked him whether he had become a hypocrite. Upon this he replied, “No, by God, I am not a hypocrite. I will certainly go to the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and inform him of what I have done. If I was a hypocrite, I would have secretly offered my prayers. I will certainly inform the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequently, he came to see the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and said, “O Messenger</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Allah! We transport water from one place to another on our camels and ensure people have water in their homes. Thus, we work all day long. Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offered the Isha prayers with you and then came to his own neighbourhood and began reciting Surah al-Baqarah.” The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned to Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and said, “O </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">! Do you wish to place the people in a trial? Why do you cause hardship for the people?” The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then advised what to recite and repeated it again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the narration of Hazrat Jabir</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said: “You ought to recite Surah al-Shams, Surah al-Duha, Surah al-Lail and Surah al-A‘la.” The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mentioned these four chapters as an example. This is a narration of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih Muslim</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih Muslim</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kitab al-Salah, Bab al-Qira‘ah fi al-Isha, Hadith 465)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a narration in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih al-Bukhari</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as follows: Hazrat Jabir</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Abdillah Ansari relates that one evening, a man was taking his camels, which would transport water and coincidentally, he saw that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was leading prayers in the mosque. Upon seeing him, he tied down his camels and began offering prayers behind Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> began reciting Surah al-Baqarah or Surah al-Nisa. This individual stopped his prayers and left, but later found out that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was displeased by this act of his. Hence he came to the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and complained about Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Upon hearing this, the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said to Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> three times, “O </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">! You wish to put the people through a grave trial? Why do you put the people through difficulty by reciting long surahs [chapters of the Holy Quran]? Why did you not recite: Surah al-A‘la, Surah al-Shams, Surah al-Lail, because in the congregation behind you, there are elderly people, some of whom are weak and there are also those who have other needs.” As mentioned earlier, this is a narration of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih al-Bukhari</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih al-Bukhari</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kitab al-Azan, Bab man shaka amamahu idha tawwala, Hadith 705)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of the advice of the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal about reciting shorter surahs in [congregational] prayers, Hazrat Khalifatul Masih II</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> writes:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was the preference of the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to recite Surah al-A‘la, Surah al-Ghashiyah, Surah al-Fajr and other similar surahs [in terms of length] in obligatory prayers. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Nisai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has related from Hazrat Jabir</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that once, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal was leading the prayers. A person came and joined in the [congregational] prayers behind him. Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prolonged the prayers; according to some narrations, he began to recite Surah al-e-Imran or Surah al-Nisa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When the prayer became prolonged, he stopped his prayers and moving to one side, began to pray on his own. When he concluded his prayer, he left. After the prayer finished, someone informed Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of what happened in that one person came and joined the prayer, but when the prayer became prolonged, he stopped the prayer and moving to one side, he began to pray on his own. After he finished his prayer, he then left. Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said that perhaps he was a hypocrite and then related the entire incident to the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He said, ‘O Messenger of Allah! I was leading the prayer when such and such person joined the prayer. But when the prayer became prolonged, he left the prayer and began to pray on his own and left once he finished.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When the person against whom the complaint was raised found out that the incident had been mentioned to the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he also came to see the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and submitted, ‘O Messenger</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Allah! I came to offer the prayers and joined in when he [i.e. Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">] was leading the prayers. However, he prolonged the prayers. We work all day long and my camel was also tied up without any food. Therefore, I stopped praying in congregation and prayed on my own to one side of the mosque. I then returned home and fed my camel.’ Upon hearing this, the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was displeased with Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and said to him, ‘O </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">! You will place the people in great difficulty. Why do you not recite Surah al-A‘la, Surah al-Shams, Surah al-Fajr or Surah al-Lail? Why did you not recite these chapters and why did you choose to recite the longer chapters?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From this incident we can conclude that the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has deemed these [aforementioned] chapters of average length. Indeed, under special conditions, one may recite the longer chapters, or when one is unwell, they may recite even shorter chapters. However, these chapters are of average length which ought to be recited during the prayers in which the Imam recites a portion of the Holy Quran out aloud.” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tafsir-e-Kabir</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 8, pp. 497, Tafsir Surah al-Fajr)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should also be remembered that this does not mean that only these chapters can be recited. The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has given a general instruction that one should not recite long chapters in congregational prayers. However, one can recite the chapters according to their own circumstances or according to what they have learnt. Some people have memorised shorter chapters and because there is nobody else to lead the congregation, they have to lead the prayers. Therefore, it is permissible for them to recite shorter chapters as well. However, the general instructions of the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that longer chapters are not to be recited in the congregational prayers because there are various people in the congregation, some of whom are elderly, some are unwell or labourers.</span></p>
<h2>Rights of Allah and His Servants</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal relates: “I was riding behind the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and there was nothing between him and me but the rear part of the saddle, when he said, ‘O </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal!’ to which I replied, ‘I am present O Messenger of Allah and at your service!’ The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> travelled for a short while, when again, he said, ‘O </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal!’ to which I replied, ‘I am present, O Messenger</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Allah and I am at your service.’ He then again travelled for a short while and said, ‘O </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal!’ to which I replied, ‘I am present, O Messenger</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Allah, and I am at your service!’ The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then said, ‘Do you know what right Allah has upon His servants?’ I submitted, ‘Allah and His Messenger</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> know best.’ The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said, ‘Verily the right of Allah over His servants is that they should worship Him and not associate anything with Him.’ The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then rode a short distance and then said, ‘O </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal!’ to which I replied, ‘I am present O Messenger of Allah and I am at your service!’ The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said, ‘Do you know what rights the servants have upon Allah?’ I replied, ‘Allah and His Messenger</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> know best.’ The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said, ‘It is that Allah will not punish them.’” That is, people must firstly fulfil the rights they owe to Allah the Almighty. When they fulfil these rights and act accordingly, then they have rights over God Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people obey Allah the Almighty’s commandments, then they are granted the right that Allah will not punish them. This is a narration of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih Muslim</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<small class="text-muted"> (</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih Muslim</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kitab al-Iman, Bab al-Dalil ala man mata ala al-Tauhid, Hadith 30)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal narrates: “I was once travelling in the company of the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Whilst we were on the journey, I moved closer and enquired, ‘O Messenger</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Allah, tell me of a deed that will take me to Paradise and will keep me away from the Hellfire.’ The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said, ‘You have asked me about a great matter indeed! Yet it is attainable for whom Allah makes it easy for.’ He further said, ‘Worship Allah and do not associate any partners with Him; observe prayer; pay the Zakat; fast in the month of Ramadan and perform the pilgrimage to the House of Allah.’</span></p>
<h2>Advice on Attaining Goodness</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then said, ‘Shall I not inform you about the doors to attain goodness?’ The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then explained, ‘I shall inform you about the doors to attain goodness. Fasting is a shield and charity washes away sins just as water extinguishes a fire; and for one to offer prayers in the middle of the night (i.e. to offer Tahajud prayers).’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then recited the following verse:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="quran" style="font-weight: 400;">تَتَجَافٰى جُنُوْبُہُمْ عَنِ الْمَضَاجِعِ یَدْعُوْنَ رَبَّہُمْ خَوْفًا وَّ طَمَعًا وَّ مِمَّا رَزَقْنٰہُمْ یُنْفِقُوْنَ۔ فَلَا تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَّا اُخْفِیَ لَہُمْ مِّنْ قُرَّۃِ اَعْیُنٍ جَزَآءً بِمَا کَانُوْا یَعْمَلُوْنَ</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“‘Their sides keep away from their beds; and they call on their Lord in fear and hope and spend out of what We have bestowed on them. And no soul knows what joy of the eyes is kept hidden for them, as a reward for their good works.’ [Ch.32: V.17-18]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> further said, ‘Shall I not inform you of the best deed, its pillar and its peak?’ The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then stated, ‘It is to perform Jihad.’ He then said, ‘Shall I not tell you the foundation of all this (i.e. it is a fundamental matter upon which everything rests)?’ I said, ‘Yes, O Messenger</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Allah.’ And so, the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took hold of his tongue and said, ‘To restrain this.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I submitted, ‘O Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Allah, will we be held accountable for what we say with it?’ The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said, ‘May Allah bless you, O </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">! There is nothing that throws people into the Hellfire upon their faces except what you reap from your tongues?’” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunan Ibn Majah,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kitab al-Fitan, Bab Kaff al-Lisan fi al-Fitnah, Hadith 3973)</span></small></p>
<h2>The Jurisprudential Committee</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Ka</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Malik narrates that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal would pass edicts [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fatwas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">] during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and also during the caliphate of Hazrat Abu Bakr</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Medina.<small class="text-muted"> (Ibn </small></span><small class="text-muted"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa‘d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vol. 2, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-‘Ilmiyyah, 1990], 265)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muhammad bin Sahl bin Abi Khaithamah narrates on the authority of his father that during the Holy Prophet’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> life, three men from the Ansar and three men from the Muhajireen would pass edicts. They were Hazrat Umar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hazrat Uthman</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hazrat Ali</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hazrat Ubayy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Ka</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">b, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal and Hazrat Zaid bin Thabit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <small class="text-muted">(Ibn </small></span><small class="text-muted"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa‘d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vol. 2, Bab Ahl al-Ilm wa al-Fatawa min Ashab Rasul Allah [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 1990], 267)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abdur Rahman bin Qasim narrates from his father that whenever Hazrat Abu Bakr</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be faced with a matter in which he needed to consult with those who possessed good judgement and knowledge of jurisprudence, he would call individuals from among the Muhajireen and the Ansar and these included Hazrat Umar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hazrat Uthman</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hazrat Ali</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hazrat Abdur Rahman</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Auf, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabl, Hazrat Ubayy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Ka</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">b and Hazrat Zaid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Thabit. All of these individuals would issue the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fatwas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [edicts] during the era of Hazrat Abu Bakr</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <small class="text-muted">(Ibn </small></span><small class="text-muted"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa‘d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vol. 2, Bab Ahl al-Ilm wa al-Fatawa min Ashab Rasul Allah [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-‘Ilmiyyah, 1990], 267)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, they formed the jurisprudential committee and were permitted to issue edicts based on their knowledge they had obtained from the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the era of Hazrat Abu Bakr</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabl migrated to Syria and settled there. Upon this, Hazrat Umar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stated that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabl’s departure had a left a void in Medina and amongst the people of Medina in the field of jurisprudence and in those matters regarding which he would issue edicts. Hazrat Umar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requested Hazrat Abu Bakr</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that he should stop him from leaving as people greatly needed him. However, Hazrat Abu Bakr</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refused saying that he could not stop anyone who had made a decision and desired to embrace martyrdom. Hazrat Umar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stated, “By God, one can attain martyrdom even whilst laying on their bed.” <small class="text-muted">(Ibn </small></span><small class="text-muted"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa‘d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vol. 2, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-‘Ilmiyyah, 1990], 265)</span></small></p>
<h2>Humility</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thaur bin Yazid relates that when Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabl would offer the Tahajjud prayer in the night, he would recite the following prayer:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O Allah! My eyes are asleep whilst the stars are shining brightly. You are the Living, the Self-Subsisting and All-Sustaining. O Allah! My desire to attain paradise is lacking and I am weak and lack the strength to escape from the hellfire. O Allah! Enable me to become among the guided, and save this for it to be granted to me on the Day of Judgment – surely You do not go against Your promise.” <small class="text-muted">(Ali Ibn al-Athir, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usd al-Ghabah fi Ma‘rifat al-Sahabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 5, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span></small><span style="font-weight: 400;"><small class="text-muted"> bin Jabal [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 2003], 188).</small></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such was the level of fear of God he had.</span></p>
<h2>The Real Meaning of “Whoever, With Sincerity of Heart, Testifies That There Is None Worthy of Worship Except Allah and Muhammad<sup>(sa)</sup> Is the Messenger of Allah, Then Allah Will Surely Safeguard Him From the Hellfire.”</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Anas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Malik relates that the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stated to Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal whilst he was sat behind the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the saddle, “O </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabl!” “O Messenger</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Allah, I am here at your service”, responded Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal. The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stated, “O </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">!” Again, he answered, “O Messenger</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Allah, I am here at your service.” The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again called his name and he submitted, “O Messenger</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Allah, I am here at your service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After calling his name out three times, the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said, “Whoever, with sincerity of heart, testifies that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the Messenger of Allah, then Allah will surely safeguard him from the Hellfire.” Upon this, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> submitted, “O Messenger</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Allah, shall I not convey this to the others as it will be a source of joy for them?” The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> replied, “Then they will only rely on this one thing and abandon all other virtues, therefore do not tell this to others.” Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only revealed this saying of the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the time of his demise, and even then, only did so lest he committed a sin for not having conveyed the words of the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih al-Bukhari</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kitab al-Ilm, Bab man Khassa bi al-‘Ilm Qauman, Hadith 128)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> felt that he ought to convey this saying to the scholars of the time but did not do this while he was alive and in good health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Waliullah Shah Sahib</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has written about this in the commentary of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bukhari</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There were certain Hadith in relation to a subject and whilst mentioning those, he also included this particular Hadith and stated: “This particular intellectual statement is only addressed to certain people because others could suffer greatly on account of failing to understand its proper meaning. It is not enough to simply proclaim that ‘there is none worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the Messenger of Allah’ and then assume that there this no need to carry out any other deed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Shah Sahib</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> further writes: “This Hadith has explained that there is a particular context to such statements.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was mentioning various Ahadith and this particular Hadith was also included in that. He then further writes: “Hazrat Ibn Mas‘ud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has recorded Hadith with the correct </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sanad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [chain of narrators] in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih Muslim</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is as follows:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="quran arabic" style="font-weight: 400;">مَا اَنْتَ بِمُحَدِّثٍ قَوْمًا حَدِیْثًا لَا یَبْلُغُہٗ عُقُوْلُھُمْ اِلَّا کَانَ لِبَعْضِھِمْ فِتْنَۃٌ</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The gist of the aforementioned saying of the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that one should address people in accordance to their intellect and level of understanding because certain statements can lead to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fitnah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, he further writes: “We see that how some people claim to be believers have made the mere verbal declaration of ‘there is none worthy of worship except Allah …’ as a way of freeing mankind from enduring the hardships of the Shariah by granting them a ‘certificate’ for their faith and whilst showing a complete disregard to all other religious obligations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">maulvi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [Muslim cleric] who delivers sermons from his pulpit claims that whoever offers their prayers behind him and recites the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalimah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he would be granted the certificate of faith and there is no need to do anything else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He further writes: “It was in the presence of these very believers who had verbally testified their complete belief to whom the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stated that in the Latter Days, faith would neither be in the hearts, nor uttered from tongues of the people of that time; rather, it would ascend into the Pleiades. This was in reference to the Latter Days. Thus, it was in this context that the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mentioned this Hadith regarding the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalimah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Hazrat Waliullah Shah Sahib</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mentions the following narration:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="quran arabic" style="font-weight: 400;">مَنْ لَقِیَ اللّٰہَ لَا یُشْرِکُ بِہٖ شَیْئًا</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One who abstains from every kind of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">shirk</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [idolatry] right till his death, will enter paradise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He further writes: “The wisdom behind the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> repeatedly calling Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s name and then remaining silent upon his response was in order to arouse his interest and passion to listen to the words of the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Thus, the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only told him this was once he was fully attentive and eager to listen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shah Sahib</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> further writes: “This was so that he would be able to truly understand what the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was going to say and so it would leave an impression on him. Thus, the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> repeated his name three times in order to draw his attention on this matter. On the other hand, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> greatly honoured what the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stated and did not disclose this to anyone, except towards the end of his life and even then it was only in fear of being held accountable by Allah the Almighty for not having conveyed something of knowledge to at least the scholars of the time.”<small class="text-muted"> (</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Translation of</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih al-Bukhari</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 1, pp. 211-212, Nazarat Ishaat Rabwah)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In regard to the aforementioned Hadith – in which it states that Allah the Almighty would safeguard those from the Hellfire who recite the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalima</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">h – it also proves that the reward of this lies with Allah alone. It is not the duty of man to issue an edict regarding one who recites the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalimah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whether they are a Muslim or not. Such self-issued edicts are also against the Quranic teachings as well.</span></p>
<h2>The Spring of Tabuk</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal narrates: “In the year when the Battle of Tabuk took place, we also left with the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would join the Zuhr and Asr prayers and also the Maghrib and Isha prayers. One day, the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> read the prayers slightly later. He came out and led the Zuhr and Asr prayers and then returned to his residence. He then came out again and led the Maghrib and Isha prayers. The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then stated, ‘Tomorrow, you will, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">InshAllah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reach the springs of Tabuk.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To clarify, it does not mean that the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led all four prayers together; rather, he joined the Zuhr prayer with the Asr and read it at the very last moments of when Asr can be offered and similarly offered the Maghrib and Isha prayer at the earliest time when Maghrib can be offered. In any case the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stated:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tomorrow when the sun has fully risen, you will reach the spring of Tabuk (the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimated that they would roughly reach during the day). Whoever among you reaches it should not touch its water or drink from it until I arrive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The narrator states, “Upon arriving, two individuals had already reached before us and there was a very small stream of water coming from it, almost as thin as the lace of a shoe. The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> asked both these individuals if they had touched the water and they both replied that they had taken water from it and also drank from it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> admonished them both, asking why they had taken some water despite the fact that he had forbidden them from doing so; and he continued to say to them that which Allah willed. The narrator says that little by little, people began taking water out of the spring until some water had accumulated in a bowl – there was only a small stream of water. The narrator says that the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> washed both hands in the bowl and washed his face as well. Then he took the water and poured it back into the spring, meaning he washed his face whilst standing by the stream and the excess water fell back into the spring. Upon this, the spring began flowing rapidly; when the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> washed his face and hands in the spring and the excess water fell back into the spring, what was once a light stream began to quickly flow and people were able to drink to their fill. Then the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said, “O </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">! If you live long enough, you will see this place become filled with gardens.” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih Muslim</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kitab al-Faza‘il, Bab fi Mu‘jazat al-Nabi, Hadith 706)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the books of Ahadith, we learn that this miracle occurred when the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had just arrived in Tabuk. According to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sirat Ibn Hisham</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this event took place on the way back from Tabuk, in a valley named Mushaqaq. <small class="text-muted">(Ibn Hisham, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Raud al-Anf fi Tafsir al-Sirah al-Nabawiyyah,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ghazwat Tabuk fi Rajab Sanah Tis‘ [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 2001], 821-822)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imam Malik</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(rh)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has also mentioned this incident in his book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muwatta.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whilst explaining this Hadith, Muhammad bin Abdul Baqi Zarqani writes that Abu Waleed Waji states that this was a prophecy which had already been fulfilled and the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically mentioned Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because he had moved to Syria and that was where he passed away. The Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was informed through revelation that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would see this place and through the blessings of the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that valley would become a place full of trees and gardens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allamah ibn Abdul Barr relates that Ibn Waddaha states that he visited the entire area surrounding that spring. He found the lushness and greenery of its trees to the extent that perhaps it would remain so until the end of time, which was exactly as the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had prophesied. <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharh Zurqani ala al-Muwatta</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 1, p. 436, Kitab Qasr al-Salah fi al-Safar, Bab al-Jam‘ baina al-Salatain, Dar Ihya al-Turath al-Arabi, Beirut, 1997)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is written in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlas Seeratun Nabawi </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that “one of the government officials in Tabuk said, ‘Until two years ago, this spring was continuously flowing for 1,375 years. Then tube wells were dug in areas at a lower altitude, and thus the water from this spring moved towards the tube wells. After being distributed among 25 tube wells, this spring has only just dried up.’ Afterwards, he took us to a tube well where we saw a four-inch pipe was installed and water was flowing from it with great force, without the use of any machine. We were told that the other tube wells were similar to this one. It is due only to the blessings from the miracle of the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that there is such an abundance of water in Tabuk, that apart from Medina and Khaybar, we have not seen as much water anywhere else. In fact the reality is that the amount of water in Tabuk is even more than these two places. Due to this water, gardens are being planted everywhere in Tabuk, and according to the prophecy of the Holy Prophet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(sa)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Tabuk is filled with gardens, which continue to increase by the day.” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlas Sirat Nabawi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, p. 431, Dar al-Islam, 1424 AH)</span></small></p>

<h2>Departure to Yemen</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) was extremely charitable and used to generously spend on others. Owing to this he often had to take loans as well. When the people who had loaned him money pressured him to return the money, he hid in his home for a few days. Upon this, these individuals went to the Holy Prophet(sa) and requested him to ask Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) to pay back the loan. The Holy Prophet(sa) sent an individual to Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) and called for him. When the debt of Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) surpassed the value of his belongings, the Holy Prophet(sa) said that God would have mercy on the person who did not seek the repayment of the loan. Accordingly, some of them forgave his debt. However, some individuals still demanded for it to be paid back. Upon this, the Holy Prophet(sa) distributed his entire belongings among those individuals, but still there was some debt outstanding. The manner in which this debt was repaid was that each lender received a small portion of their money, but they demanded for the remaining amount to be paid back as well. Upon this, the Holy Prophet(sa) said to leave the matter for the time being as there was nothing more to give, therefore they ought to take that amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) was left with nothing, the Holy Prophet(sa) sent him to Yemen and said that Allah will soon compensate for his loss and enable him to pay off his debt.<small class="text-muted"> (Sheikh Shah Moinuddin Ahmad Nadvi, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siyar al-Sahabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 3, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal [Karachi, Pakistan: Dar al-Isha‘ah, 2004], 502) (Ali Ibn al-Athir, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usd al-Ghabah fi Ma‘rifat al-Sahabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 5, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 2003], 188) (Ibn </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa‘d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vol. 3, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal… [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 1990], 441)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this occasion, the Holy Prophet(sa) also said to Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra), “O </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">! You have a lot of debt. Therefore, if you are presented with a gift, you may accept it. I permit you to do so.” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siyar al-Sahabah,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vol. 5, p. 146, Dar al-Isha‘ah, Lahore)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Holy Prophet(sa) said that he was permitted to accept gifts – under normal circumstances, there is nothing wrong in accepting gifts and it is said that giving each other gifts increases the love between people, and so one ought to give gifts. However, since Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) was sent as a representative of the Holy Prophet(sa), he specifically instructed him that if he was presented with any gifts in his capacity as a representative, then he was permitted to spend it on himself. The reason for this [special permission] was that these gifts were generally given for the treasury [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bait al-Maal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">], or for the Holy Prophet(sa).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal relates that when the Holy Prophet(sa) sent him to Yemen, the Holy Prophet(sa) walked outside with him in order to impart some advice. Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) was seated on his mount and the Holy Prophet(sa) walked alongside him. When the Holy Prophet(sa) completed what he had to say, he added, “O </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">! It is possible that we may not meet in the coming year and it is also possible that you will pass by my mosque and my grave.” Hearing this, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) started to weep profusely because he was parting from the Holy Prophet(sa). Following this, the Holy Prophet(sa) turned his blessed face towards Medina and said, “The righteous from among my people are near and dear to me, whoever they may be and wherever they may be.” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Musnad </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal, Vol. 7, p. 359, Hadith 22402, Alam ul-Kutub, Beirut, 1998)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is stated in one narration that on this occasion, the Holy Prophet(sa) said to Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra), “Soon you shall go to those who are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahl-e-Kitab</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [people of the book]. When you reach them, invite them to bear witness that there in none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they accept this, then inform them that Allah has prescribed for them the five daily prayers. If they accept this, then inform them that Allah has prescribed for them the giving of alms, which should be taken from their wealthy and given to their poor. If they accept this as well, then beware; do not take alms from their most valuable possessions, rather adopt the middle course with regard to taking from their wealth. And beware of the curse of the oppressed, for there is no barrier between them and Allah.” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sahih al-Bukhari</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kitab al-Maghazi, Bab Ba‘th Abi Musa wa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ila Yaman…, Hadith 347)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Holy Prophet(sa) specifically advised him to be cautious lest he became the object of the prayers of those who are oppressed as there is no barrier between their pleas and Allah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Holy Prophet(sa) sent Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal to Yemen as a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">qazi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) would teach [the people of Yemen] the Holy Quran and matters of faith and would also settle their disputes. Those who collected Zakat in Yemen would send whatever they had collected to Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal. The Holy Prophet(sa) had entrusted five companions to oversee matters in Yemen; Hazrat Khalid(ra) bin Saeed, Hazrat Muhajir(ra) bin Umayyah, Hazrat Zaid(ra) bin Labeed, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal and Hazrat Abu Musa Ash‘ari(ra). <small class="text-muted">(Ibn Abd al-Barr, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Isti‘ab fi Ma‘rifat al-Ashab</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 3, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Jil, 1992], 460)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to this narration, the administering of matters in Yemen was entrusted to these five companions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal relates that when the Holy Prophet(sa) sent him to Yemen, he instructed, for every 30 cows, take a one-year-old calf as Zakat and for every 40 cows, take a two-year-old cow (the Holy Prophet(sa) was stipulating the prescribed rate of Zakat and the threshold on which Zakat becomes obligatory) and from every person who has reached the age of maturity, take one dinar or the equivalent in</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> m‘afirah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,’ which was the name of a Yemeni cloth. In fact, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">m‘afirah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the name of a tribe which made this cloth and thus the cloth was named after them. This narration is from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Musnad </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal, Vol. 7, p. 348, Hadith 22363, Alam ul-Kutub, Beirut, 1998) (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lughaat-ul-Hadith</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 3, p. 142, Pir Muhammad Kutub Khana Aram Bagh, Karachi)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allamah ibn </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa‘d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal had a slight limp. When he went to Yemen, he led the people in prayer and whilst doing so, he extended his leg – meaning he must have placed it before him or extended it to the right or to whichever side his foot was impaired – and [those following him in prayer] also extended their legs in the same manner. When he had finished leading the prayer, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) said, “You have done well to follow exactly as I have done; however, you must abstain from doing so in the future. I am compelled to extend my leg owing to my condition.” <small class="text-muted">(Ibn </small></span><small class="text-muted"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa‘d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vol. 3, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal… [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 1990], 439)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What he meant was that the obedience which they had shown by doing exactly what he did was indeed praiseworthy. This in fact was true obedience, as whatever the imam does should be followed precisely. However, he was compelled to act in this way [i.e. to extend his leg] and this was not the practice of the Holy Prophet(sa). Whoever is not compelled [by an ailment or injury] should offer their prayers according to the commandments, teachings and practice adopted by the Holy Prophet(sa).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) conducted business in Yemen using money from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bait-ul-mal </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[treasury] and repaid his debts with the profits he made. He was the first person to conduct business with the wealth given in the way of Allah Almighty and this was done with the permission from the Holy Prophet(sa). He also accepted gifts as a result of which he eventually had 30 livestock animals. <small class="text-muted">(Sheikh Shah Moinuddin Ahmad Nadvi, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siyar al-Sahabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 3,  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal [Karachi, Pakistan: Dar al-Isha‘ah, 2004], 505) (Ibn Abd al-Barr, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Isti‘ab fi Ma‘rifat al-Ashab</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 3,  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Jil, 1992], 1404)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, he used this wealth according to the permission granted by the Holy Prophet(sa), which most certainly was for the purpose of repaying his debts. He conducted business only to the extent of using the profits to repay his debts. Or if he did not use the profits for this purpose, it is also possible he would retain it as remuneration for his work [for the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bait-ul-mal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">]. The Holy Prophet(sa) had given him permission for this, which is why he took it and used it to repay his debts. This fact seems the most accurate in that he would take a certain amount from the profits made as remuneration. Nevertheless, his actions were in line with the permission granted by the Holy Prophet(sa).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the demise of the Holy Prophet(sa), when Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) went to perform Hajj, he met Hazrat Umar(ra), who had been appointed by Hazrat Abu Bakr(ra) to oversee matters pertaining to the Hajj. Hazrat Umar(ra) and Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) met on the day of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tarwiyyah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They embraced each other and expressed their condolences to one another for the demise of the Holy Prophet(sa). Then they both sat on the ground and began conversing. <small class="text-muted">(Ibn </small></span><small class="text-muted"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa‘d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vol. 3,  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal… [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 1990], 441)</span></small></p>
<h2>Generosity and Benevolence</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is written in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Al Isti‘ab</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a book of history, that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) was very generous and it was due to this generosity and benevolence that he fell into debt. He went to the Holy Prophet(sa) and requested him to ask those whom he owed to forgive his debt. This is the same incident mentioned earlier but from another source. The Holy Prophet(sa) made this request to those who he owed money to, but they refused to forgive the debt. Had they agreed to forgive the debts of Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal for anyone’s sake, it would have been for the sake of the Holy Prophet(sa), as his rank and status was the greatest. Thus, it could only have been for his sake that one would forgive the debts owed to them or would present financial sacrifices. However, as mentioned earlier, some people refused and said, “O Messenger(sa) of Allah, we will take the debt owed to us.” Then, in order to repay these debts, the Holy Prophet(sa) sold off the properties of Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal and he was left with no wealth or possessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same year as the Conquest of Mecca, the Holy Prophet(sa) sent Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) as a governor [Amir] in one part of Yemen. Here it becomes clear that he was sent in the capacity of a governor; thus, any gifts he received in this capacity would have been considered as part of the treasury. He was the first person to conduct business from the treasury using the wealth given in the way of Allah. He remained in Yemen until the Holy Prophet’s(sa) demise, by which time he had become affluent. During this period, his business became profitable and whatever portion he would take led him to become well-off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, when he returned [to Medina], Hazrat Umar(ra) said to Hazrat Abu Bakr(ra), “He (i.e. Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra)) should be summoned and aside from the necessities he requires, the rest of his wealth should be taken off him. The Holy Prophet(sa) only granted him permission for the sake of repaying his debts and now his debts have been repaid. He should keep the basic necessities he requires; however, he should not have accumulated wealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the viewpoint of Hazrat Umar(ra) that he ought to keep what is required and return the rest of the wealth.  The matter was then presented before Hazrat Abu Bakr(ra). The degree of love which Hazrat Abu Bakr(ra) had for the Holy Prophet(sa) did not allow him to bear that he should make a decision contrary to something for which the Holy Prophet(sa) had granted permission. Thus, Hazrat Abu Bakr(ra) said, “The Holy Prophet(sa) sent him and I shall not take anything back from him”; he sent him off, saying that he had permission to conduct business and use the profit from it, “unless he wishes to return it to me himself, as I will not take anything from him. He went upon the instructions of the Holy Prophet(sa) and accepted gifts and other things with his permission. Unless he offers it to me himself, I shall not ask him to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Umar(ra) then went to Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra). Hazrat Umar(ra) was very resolute when it came to certain matters of principle, so he went to Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) and mentioned this all to him. Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) replied, “The Holy Prophet(sa) sent me so that I may fulfil my requirements, so I shall not give anything of it.” It is also established through the various accounts and the biographies of his life that if Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) ever did pass through times of prosperity, they would only last for a few days, as he would regularly distribute his wealth among the people. We shall see in the accounts later on just how he would distribute it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) thereafter went to Hazrat Umar(ra) and said, “I accept what you said.” Previously, he said to Hazrat Umar(ra) that he would not give anything, but after some time, he went to Hazrat Umar(ra) and said he accepted and consented to what he had asked and would act according to what he said. This must have been after some time because there is a mention of a dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) stated, “I saw in the dream that I am drowning in water and you [i.e. Hazrat Umar(ra)] rescued me.” Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) then went to Hazrat Abu Bakr(ra), related everything to him and vowed, “I shall not hide a single thing from you.” Meaning from where and how he received the money. Hazrat Abu Bakr(ra) said, “I shall not take a thing from you. Yes, you have related all of this to me and accounted for everything, but I shall take nothing from you and I have given it all to you as a gift.” Hazrat Umar(ra), who was also present, said, “This is the best solution.” <small class="text-muted">(Ibn Abd al-Barr, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Isti‘ab fi Ma‘rifat al-Ashab</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 3, Bab Harf al-Meem,  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Jil, 1992], 461)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he came to know that now the Khalifa of the time had made a decision even after Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) had offered all the money, Hazrat Umar(ra) accepted the decision with complete obedience. It did not matter to him as to why it was being taken; all that mattered was that after the demise of the Holy Prophet(sa), the decision should rest with the Khalifa of the time as to whether or not he could keep the wealth and spend out of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to this, Hazrat Umar(ra) was insisting that the wealth should be taken from Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra), but when Hazrat Abu Bakr(ra) made his decision that he would not take it from him and that he would give it all back to him as a gift, Hazrat Umar(ra) did not insist on the matter and stated, “Indeed, this is the best solution in relation to this matter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, there is further clarification that God Almighty did not draw Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s(ra) attention to this matter until his needs had been fulfilled. Furthermore, after the demise of the Holy Prophet(sa) and when Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s(ra) needs were also fulfilled, he was granted prosperity and his debts were paid off, only then did God Almighty draw Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s attention to this matter through a dream in which he was told that he should now suffice on his own property. In other words, he should no longer accept gifts in the capacity of being the governor, nor spend out of the treasury. He did not remain there for long after this, but in any case, this was a brief explanation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) relates that when the Holy Prophet(sa) sent him towards Yemen, he asked, “How will you deal with a matter when it is brought before you?” He answered, “I shall decide in accordance with the Book of Allah.” The Holy Prophet(sa) then asked, “And if you do not find the command in the Book of Allah?” to which Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) replied, “I shall decide in accordance with the practice [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunnah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">] of Allah’s Messenger(sa).” The Holy Prophet(sa) then asked, “And if you do not find the instruction in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunnah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Messenger of Allah?” Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) answered, “I shall form my opinion according to my reasoning and shall not show any carelessness in this regard.” Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) states that when the Holy Prophet(sa) had listened to these three things, he placed his hand upon his chest and said, “All praise belongs to Allah, Who has enabled the ambassador of the Messenger(sa) of Allah to become a source of joy for him.” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Musnad </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal, Vol. 7, p. 347, Hadith 22357, Alam ul-Kutub, Beirut, 1998)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) narrates that when the Holy Prophet(sa) sent him to Yemen he instructed him not to adopt a life of comfort and ease, because the servants of Allah do not live a life of worldly comforts. <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Musnad </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal, Vol. 7, p. 375, Hadith 22456, Alam ul-Kutub, Beirut, 1998)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This further clarifies that the Holy Prophet(sa) was aware that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) was very generous and that he would spend the wealth from gifts and trade to help those in need. Even so, after giving permission for this, the Holy Prophet(sa) advised him not to live a life of comfort; instead, it was merely to fulfil his [basic] needs. So he admonished him to refrain from this.</span></p>
<h2>Advices of the Holy Prophet(sa)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) relates, “When I placed my foot in the stirrup as I was about to depart to Yemen, the Holy Prophet(sa) gave me a final piece of advice, saying, ‘Meet people in a courteous manner, meet the people in a courteous manner.’” <small class="text-muted">(Ibn </small></span><small class="text-muted"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa‘d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vol. 3, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal… [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 1990], 439)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, look at the condition of the Muslims of today. Do they conduct themselves in this manner? And yet, they celebrate the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">milad-un-Nabi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [birthday of the Holy Prophet(sa)]? The true essence of commemorating </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">milad-un-Nabi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is by following the example of the Holy Prophet(sa) and to act upon his teachings. When the Holy Prophet(sa) sent Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) as the governor of Yemen, he described his status in the following words:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="quran arabic" style="font-weight: 400;">اِنِّیْ بَعَثْتُ لَکُمْ خَیْرَ اَھْلِیْ</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">meaning, “Surely I send to you the best of my people.” <small class="text-muted">(Sheikh Shah Moinuddin Ahmad Nadvi, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siyar al-Sahabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 3, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal [Karachi, Pakistan: Dar al-Isha‘ah, 2004], 502)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ibn Abi Naji‘ narrates that the Holy Prophet(sa) appointed Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) as the governor of Yemen, stating to the people of Yemen, “Indeed I have sent to you a governor who is the most knowledgeable of my people and the most well-versed in the matters of faith.” <small class="text-muted">(Ibn Sa’d, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vol. 3, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal… [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 1990], 438-439)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Hadith of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is mentioned that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) related, “The Holy Prophet(sa) gave me 10 instructions, saying, ‘The first is to not associate any partners with Allah, even if you are killed or thrown into the fire. Secondly, to not disobey one’s parents, even if they deprive you of your share in the inheritance.’” One should not disobey their parents, no matter what happens, even if one received nothing from them. “‘The third advice is to not miss any obligatory prayer knowingly, for one who abandons an obligatory prayer on purpose deprives himself from the support and protection of God Almighty.’ The Holy Prophet(sa) then said, ‘Never consume alcohol, for this is the root of every indecency.’ He then stated, ‘Abstain from sin and disobedience, because sin draws the displeasure of God Almighty.’ He then said, ‘When facing the enemy in battle, you must not flee. If you are confronted by the enemy, then you should not run away out of fear, even if the people are killed.’ He then stated, ‘If the people are afflicted with an epidemic such as the plague, they should remain wherever they are.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they reside in an area where there is an outbreak of the plague, then the Holy Prophet(sa) has instructed that one should remain where they are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Holy Prophet(sa) further stated, ‘Spend on your family according to your means, fulfil their rights and do not show any negligence in their moral training, (even if one has to show a little strictness in their moral training then one should do so to ensure for a good upbringing), instil the fear of God in them.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These were the ten things the Holy Prophet(sa) advised him about. <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Musnad </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal, Vol. 7, p. 366, Hadith 22425, Alam ul-Kutub, Beirut, 1998)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Ibn Umar(ra) narrates that the Holy Prophet(sa) said to Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra), “I shall grant you advice like a kind-hearted brother. I advise you to instil the fear of Allah in you, visit the sick, fulfil the needs of the widows and the elderly, comfort those who are in need, dispense justice, speak the truth and never allow your fear of being rebuked stop you in matters relating to God. This is the advice I give to you.” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kanz al-Ummal,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vol. 15, Hadith 43555, Kitab al-Mawa‘idh…, Chapter 10, Mu‘assisah al-Risalah, Beirut, 1985)</span></small></p>
<h2>Zeal to Spend on the Poor</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On one occasion, Hazrat Umar(ra) asked his companions to express their desire for something. One of them replied, “I wish this house be filled with gold, so I may spend it in the way of Allah as sadaqah.” Another stated, “I wish this house be filled with pearls and rubies, so I may spend it in the way of Allah as Sadaqah.” How lofty were the aspirations of the companions(ra)! Hazrat Umar(ra) then asked them to further express what they desired. They submitted, “O Leader of the Faithful, we do not understand as to what it is that we should desire?” Hazrat Umar(ra) stated, “I wish that this house be filled with people like Hazrat Abu Ubaidah(ra) bin Jarrah, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal, Salim(ra), the freed slave of Abu Huzaifah(ra) and Hazrat Huzaifah(ra) bin Yaman.” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Mustadrak Ala al-Sahihain</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 3, p. 252, Hadith 5005, Kitab Marifat al-Sahabah, Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, Beirut, 2002)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) lived in Yemen for two years, from 9 AH to 11 AH. <small class="text-muted">(Sheikh Shah Moinuddin Ahmad Nadvi, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siyar al-Sahabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 3, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal [Karachi, Pakistan: Dar al-Isha‘ah, 2004], 505)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On one occasion, Hazrat Umar(ra) bin Khattab placed 400 dinar in a money pouch and told one of his emissaries to take it to Hazrat Abu Ubaidah(ra) bin Jarrah and remain there for a while and to take note of what he did with it. And so, the emissary went to Hazrat Abu Ubaidah(ra) bin Jarrah(ra) with the small pouch of money and said, “The Leader of the Faithful has given this to you and said you may use it to fulfil any need you may have with it.” Hazrat Abu Ubaidah(ra) replied, “May Allah bestow His mercy upon him.” He then called one of his maidservants and told her to give 7 dinars to such and such person, five to such and such, five to such and such and in this way, he distributed the entire amount.” In other words, he called his maidservant and asked her to distribute all the wealth to the various houses, who perhaps were in need of it. The emissary returned to Hazrat Umar(ra) and related the entire incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat Umar(ra) had prepared another pouch for Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) which contained the same amount of money that was sent to Hazrat Abu Ubaidah(ra). Hazrat Umar(ra) told the emissary to give the pouch to Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) and again instructed him to remain in his house for a while and observe what he did with it. And so, the emissary took the pouch and went to Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) and said, “The Leader of the Faithful(ra) has said that you may use this to fulfil whatever needs you may have.” Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) replied, “May Allah bestow His mercy upon him.” Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) then called his maidservant and told her to give a certain amount to such and such house and a certain amount to such and such house. Whilst Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) was distributing the wealth, his wife entered and said, “By God, we are also in need of it for there is nothing in the house. Please keep something for us as well.” This narration further clarifies the earlier narration regarding making a profit and receiving gifts. His wife stated that they had nothing at home and thus, they too were in need of it. By then, all the money had been distributed and only two dinars remained in the pouch which Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal handed over to his wife. The emissary returned to Hazrat Umar(ra) and related the entire incident. Hazrat Umar(ra) was extremely pleased by this and stated, “Indeed, Hazrat Ubaidah(ra) and Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) are like two brothers.” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Majma al-Zawa‘id wa Manba al-Fawa‘id,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kitab al-Zakah, Bab fi al-Infaq, Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, Beirut, 2001)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, this attribute of spending [on others] was shared by both.</span></p>
<h2>Lofty Status</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it narrated by Shuraih bin Ubaid, Rashid bin </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sa‘d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, etc. that when Hazrat Umar(ra) reached Saragh, which is the name of a settlement situated near the valley of Tabuk, he was informed that there was a very severe outbreak of a plague in Syria. Subsequently, Hazrat Umar(ra) announced, “I have been informed that there is a very severe outbreak of the plague in Syria. Thus, if I am about to die and Abu Ubaidah(ra) is alive then I shall appoint him as the Khalifa. And if Allah the Almighty asks me as to why I appointed him as the Khalifah of the Muslim Ummah, I will submit that I heard His Messenger(sa) say that every prophet is granted a custodian [for his Ummah] and the custodian [of his Ummah] is Abu Ubaidah bin Jarrah.” However, people expressed their concern over this and enquired as to what would happen to the prominent members of the Quraish, i.e. the Banu Fehr. Hazrat Umar(ra) then stated, “If my demise is imminent and Abu Ubaidah bin Jarrah has also passed away, then I shall appoint </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal as the Khalifa. If my Lord, the Glorious and Exalted were to ask me as to why I appointed him, I will submit that I heard His messenger(sa) say that on the Day of Judgement, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal will walk ahead of the scholars of faith.” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Musnad al-Khulafa al-Rashidin, Musnad Umar al-Khattab, Vol. 1, p. 109, Hadith 108, Alam al-Kutub, Beirut, 1998) (Yaqut Ibn Abd Allah al-Hamawi, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘jam al-Buldan, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vol. 3 [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar Ihya al-Turath al-Arabi], 239)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the lofty status Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal occupied in regard to his knowledge.</span></p>
<h2>Battle of Yarmuk</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Battle of Yarmuk in 15 AH, Hazrat Abu Ubaidah(ra) and Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal were appointed commanders on the right flank of the army. The Christians attacked with such intensity that the right flank of the army broke away from the rest of the army and consequently the soldiers became dispersed. Upon witnessing these circumstances, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal displayed great courage and remained resolute. He stepped down from his horse and said that he would now fight on foot and if there was anyone who could do justice by fighting on a horse, then his horse was at their service. Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal’s son was also present in the battlefield and he said, “I shall do justice to it because I can fight better on horse” And so, both father and son, penetrated into the Byzantine forces and fought so valiantly that the Muslims who had initially lost their footing were now able to regroup and thus by defeating the enemy, their state of fear was transformed into victory for the Muslims. <small class="text-muted">(Sheikh Shah Moinuddin Ahmad Nadvi, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siyar al-Sahabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 3, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal [Karachi, Pakistan: Dar al-Isha‘ah, 2004], 508) (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feroz al-Lughat,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> p. 1332, zir Lafz Maimanah)</span></small></p>
<h2>Loving One Another for the Sake of Allah</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abu Idrees Khaulani narrates, “When I entered into the mosque in Damascus, Syria, I saw a young man with bright shining teeth and people were sitting around him. Whenever people had a difference of opinion on a matter, they would present the matter to him and would give precedence to his opinion on the matter. When I enquired about him, I was informed that he was Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The next day in the afternoon, I went again and saw that he was already there before me and was offering his prayers. I waited and when he finished his prayer, I went before him and conveyed the greetings of peace. I then said, ‘I swear by Allah, I love you for His sake.’ Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal asked, ‘Do you swear by Allah?’ I replied, ‘Yes, I swear by Allah.’ Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal again asked, ‘Do you swear by Allah?’ I again replied, ‘Yes, I swear by Allah.’ Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal then took hold of the corner of my cloak and pulled me towards himself and said, ‘Rejoice, for I have heard the Messenger(sa) of Allah say that Allah the Exalted has stated, “Those who show love to one another for My sake, those who sit with one another for My sake, those who meet one another for My sake and those who spend their wealth for one another for My sake, will most surely be granted My love.”’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, Allah the Almighty’s love will become incumbent for them.<small class="text-muted"> (</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Musnad </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal, Vol. 7, p. 353-354, Hadith 22380, Alam al-Kutub, Beirut, 1998)</span></small></p>
<h2>Level of Justice</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one of the narrations it states that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal had two wives. When it would be the turn of one wife, he would not even take water to drink from the other wife’s house; such were his standards of justice. In another narration it states that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal had two wives. When it would be the turn of one wife, he would not even perform the ablution in the house of the other. Both of his wives passed away in Syria owing to the plague and both were buried in one grave. Whilst they were being buried, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal drew a lot to decide who would be lowered into the grave first. This was the level of justice he possessed. <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hilyat al-Auliya</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 1, Ch. 1, p. 204; Translated by Muhammad Asghar Mughal, Dar al-Isha‘ah, Karachi, 2006)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another narration in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siyar al-Sahaba</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it states that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal had two wives who passed away due to the Plague of Amwas and it is also reported that one of his sons, Abdur Rahman, who took part in the Battle of Yarmuk alongside Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal also passed away due to the Plague of Amwas – this was a plague that spread during that time. <small class="text-muted">(Sheikh Shah Moinuddin Ahmad Nadvi, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siyar al-Sahabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 3, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal [Karachi, Pakistan: Dar al-Isha‘ah, 2004], 510-511)</span></small></p>
<h2>Demise</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Hazrat Abu Ubaidah(ra) passed away due to the Plague of Amwas, Hazrat Umar(ra) appointed Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal as the governor of Syria (Amwas was the name of a settlement situated 7 miles from Ramla in the direction of Jerusalem). Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) also passed away due to the Plague of Amwas in the same year. <small class="text-muted">(Ibn Abd al-Barr, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">al-Isti‘ab fi Ma‘rifat al-Ashab</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 3, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Jil, 1992], 1405) (Yaqut Ibn Abd Allah al-Hamawi, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘jam al-Buldan, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vol. 4 [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar Ihya al-Turath al-Arabi], 177-178)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathir bin Murrah relates that during the period of his illness, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal told them, “I have heard the Holy Prophet(sa) say something which till now I have kept hidden from you. I heard the Holy Prophet(sa) say that entrance into Paradise will become incumbent for one who states, ‘There is none worthy of worship except Allah.’” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Musnad </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal, Vol. 7, p. 355, Hadith 22383, Alam al-Kutub, Beirut, 1998)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another narration it states that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) stated, “The only reason why I did not inform you of this Hadith was lest you solely relied on this and abandoned all other good deeds.” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Musnad </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal, Vol. 7, p. 361, Hadith 22410, Alam al-Kutub, Beirut, 1998)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the plague spread in Syria, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal also became ill due to the plague and owing to his illness was overcome with a state of unconsciousness. When he regained consciousness, he stated, “O Allah, cause this affliction [i.e. the plague] to take over me. I swear by Your honour that indeed You are aware that I love You.” Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal again fell unconscious and when he regained consciousness, he again offered the same prayer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearer to the time of his demise, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal asked if it was morning and was informed that the daybreak had not occurred yet. When dawn broke, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal was subsequently informed and he said, “I seek refuge in Allah from the night whose morning takes one to the hell-fire. I welcome death and to meet my beloved who comes after a long time. O Allah, You indeed know that I fear You, but today I am in hope. I do not love the world and seek a long life so that I can dig streams and plant trees, rather so that I may endure the intense thirst of midday and the difficulties of my circumstances and sit in the company of those scholars who remain occupied in Your remembrance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another narration it is mentioned that when Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) was close to his demise, he began to cry. Some people asked him why he was crying as he was a companion of the Holy Prophet(sa). He replied, “I am not crying because I fear death, nor am I crying because I am departing this world. The reason why I am crying is that there are only two groups of people: those who are heaven-bound and those who are hell-bound, and I do not know from which of these two groups I will be raised up again after death. I only fear Allah the Almighty and that is why I am crying.” <small class="text-muted">(Ali Ibn al-Athir, </small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usd al-Ghabah fi Ma‘rifat al-Sahabah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 5, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal [Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, 2003], 189)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there is a narration of Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) in which he states, “I heard the Holy Prophet(sa) say, ‘Very soon you will migrate to Syria and it will be conquered at your hands. But then you will suffer from an outbreak of a disease which will consist of boils and blisters or cause a sharp pain. It will appear below the navel region and Allah will grant martyrdom to some people through this and will purify their deeds.’ O Allah! If it is true that indeed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal heard these words from the Holy Prophet(sa), then grant me and my family a large share from it [i.e. from the prophecy about the plague].” Thus, they all [i.e. Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) and his household] suffered from this plague and not a single one of them survived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the boil of the plague became visible on Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s(ra) index finger, he would say that this pleased him greatly and that even if he were given red camels, it would not please him more.<small class="text-muted"> (</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Musnad </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal, Vol. 7, p. 371, Hadith 22439, Alam al-Kutub, Beirut, 1998)</span></small></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Tabari it is stated that a boil developed in the palm of his hand.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal passed away in 18 AH.

<p style="text-align: center;">(<a href='https://www.alislam.org/friday-sermon/2020-11-13.html' target='_blank'>Friday Sermon - November 13, 2020 <i class='fa fa-external-link' aria-hidden='true'></i></a>)</p>
<h2>Clarification</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A narration from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been presented in which there was mention of the plague. The Holy Prophet(sa) said “You will soon migrate to Syria and it will be conquered at your hands. However, there, you will suffer from a disease consisting of boils and blisters, which will catch a person at the rung of the ladder.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a mistake in the translation and therefore the meaning was not accurately conveyed and subsequently it did not explain the reality of the matter. The account again with its correct translation is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ismail bin Ubaidullah narrates that Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) bin Jabal stated:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I heard the Holy Prophet(sa) say, ‘You will soon travel to Syria and will conquer it. There, a disease will break out among you, which will resemble a boil or will be something that will give a sharp and severe pain. It will appear below one’s navel.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, the translation [which was originally quoted], “which will catch a person at the rung of the ladder” was incorrectly translated. The correct translation is that it will appear below the navel; just as a boil develops on the lower part of the body, under the navel and above the leg. The Holy Prophet(sa) stated that through this, Allah the Almighty would grant people martyrdom and as a result of this, He would purify their deeds. Following this, Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra) prayed, “O Allah! If You are aware of the fact that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal heard these words from the Holy Prophet(sa), then grant him and his family a large portion of this [glad tiding of martyrdom].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of this, all of them were struck by the plague and not one of them was spared. When the boil of the plague developed on the index finger of Hazrat </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ra), he said, “I will not rejoice if I were given red camels in exchange for this.” <small class="text-muted">(</small></span><small class="text-muted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vol. 7, p. 371, Musnad </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu‘az</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bin Jabal, Hadith 22,439, Alam al-Kutub, Beirut, 1998)</span></small></p>
