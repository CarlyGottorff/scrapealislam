<blockquote><p><em>During his concluding address of the Germany Annual Convention 2022, His Holiness<sup>(aba)</sup> describes the world in crisis and on the precipice of global catastrophe, and outlines the lasting solutions to finding real peace. The English translation of this address is presented below:</em></p></blockquote>
<p>After reciting the <em>Tashahhud, Ta‘awwudh,</em> and<em> Surah al-Fatihah</em>, His Holiness<sup>(aba)</sup> stated:</p>
<p>‘It is a great blessing and favour of Allah the Almighty that despite the current circumstances of the world, He has enabled the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama’at [Community] Germany to hold its Jalsa Salana [Annual Gathering]. Moreover, they are holding this Jalsa on a much larger scale than the previous year. Initially, the COVID-19 pandemic was a cause of great apprehension for the world and while this concern is still ongoing, the current situation of global warfare has brought the world to the brink of an extremely perilous state and no part of the world seems to be safe from this looming devastation. Until people do not turn towards the One and Only God, they cannot be safeguarded from this destruction.</p>
<p>At first, Europe, the West and the developed nations were under the impression that those regions and countries where war, conflict and destruction are taking place are thousands of miles away from them and that they are safe from it. They thought that, “although the situation is dire, bombs are exploding, people are dying, women are being widowed, children are being orphaned and people are being physically deformed, it is all happening in Asia, Middle East and in the poorer nations, and so it makes no difference to us.”</p>
<p>Developed countries continued to supply these countries with ammunition, so that their arms trade could continue, all the while thinking that if these people die then so be it, for it makes no difference to them. However, they failed to realise that they too could be engulfed by the same circumstances. Their efforts to continue “progressing” clouded their senses and blinded them, as it were. Now, the entire world can see for itself that the threat of what could potentially unfold is precisely taking place and conditions of war have emerged in Europe as well.</p>
<p>Over the issue of Ukraine, Russia and the member countries of NATO are standing in opposition to one another. Only Allah the Almighty knows best as to who will eventually be victorious, or how much loss will be incurred by both sides. However, what is for certain is that this will have catastrophic consequences. Even now if the world does not act with sense, it will lead to a harrowing devastation.</p>
<p>We are also witnessing the escalating situation in Taiwan, which clearly shows that the entire world is standing at the brink of a devastating war. The one who has been appointed by Allah the Almighty in this era has issued a very strong warning,</p>
<p>“O Europe, you are not safe and O Asia, you too, are not immune. And O dwellers of Islands, no false gods shall come to your rescue. I see cities fall and settlements laid waste.” <sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p>It is owing to this very admonishment and warning that the Khalifas [Caliphs] of the Ahmadiyya Community have been drawing attention towards this from time to time. I have also been drawing their attention towards this for some time and have been stating that if the world does not turn towards the One and Only God, then destruction is certain. I have been telling them for a while that blocs are being formed and this will ultimately result in the destruction of one another, hence they ought to pay heed. However, most of them listened to these words and do so now as well, but say that though the circumstances are somewhat dire, they are not as devastating and hopeless as you are depicting them. People have said this to me personally and also to the members of the Community. However, now, these very people, who used to look at these matters superficially, have started to acknowledge that these circumstances are continuing to worsen and if these circumstances prevail, a devastating war can break out at any moment.</p>
<p>Now, this is generally being spoken of by their think-tanks and analysts, yet they still do not have the solutions to establish lasting peace. How could they, considering that their attention is not turning towards the true source of peace? They are engulfed by the world and have disregarded faith. And where the solution lies [i.e., the teachings of Islam], regrettably not only do non-Muslim nations fail to draw nearer to it, the Muslim powers are also distant from it.</p>
<p>Some analysts are now even saying that the destruction that could be caused by these wars would be so devastating, that according to one estimate, 66% of the world’s population will be wiped away during the war and within the following two years due to the use of atomic weapons. The devastation will be of an unimaginable scale. An ordinary person cannot even fathom it. Hence, these are very alarming circumstances.</p>
<p>If there is a ray of hope and a guarantee of peace, it is in the one and only person who was sent with the teaching of peace and harmony to the world. He is the person who is the King of Peace and he is more beloved to Allah the Almighty than all others. He is the one who brought the final and complete law, whose teachings are filled with love and kindness. Due to his strong relationship with God Almighty, his deep concern to spread the teaching that was revealed to him, to save the world from its destruction and his angst for the state of mankind, he had put his own life in extreme pain and hardship. He had become burdened and pained out of his own concern for people and he yearned and cried so much in his prayers for the world that Allah the Almighty said to the Holy Prophet Muhammad<sup>(sa)</sup>:</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;">لَعَلَّكَ بَٰخِعٞ نَّفۡسَكَ أَلَّا يَكُونُواْ مُؤۡمِنِينَ</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">“Haply thou wilt grieve thyself to death because they believe not.” <sup>[2]</sup></p>
<p>Such was the love he had for humanity that they may turn to their Creator and save themselves, both in this life and in the hereafter.</p>
<p>He imparted such a comprehensive teaching which no other teaching can compare to. He presented such a guarantee for peace which in reality is the guarantee from Allah the Almighty, yet, regrettably, even the Muslims have forgotten this teaching. They simply make verbal proclamations of faith and have in fact become thirsty for each other’s blood and seek help from other non-Muslims for this cause. Those who recite the <em>kalimah</em> [Islamic creed] are killing one another with the support of the enemies of religion. What greater misfortune can befall the Muslims?</p>
<p>Despite claiming to follow such beautiful teachings and such a compassionate Messenger (sa), they are incurring the displeasure of Allah the Almighty. Instead of spreading peace and harmony in the world, they are becoming more and more infamous for spreading unrest. This is due to the fact that they are not even willing to listen to the words of the true servant of the King of Peace and most beloved of Allah the Almighty, who was sent to the world in this era to spread the teachings of peace and harmony. It is not merely the case that they refuse to listen to him, they have gone to the extent of deeming the issuing of edicts of disbelief against [the Promised Messiah<sup>(as)</sup>] and his followers and to kill them as a service to Islam and a standard for expressing their love for the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup>, the Chosen One and the Seal of the Prophets. To play with the lives of Ahmadis is worthy of reward in their view. Hence, how can such people spread Islam’s teachings of peace to the world? If only these people would come to their senses. If only their clerics would become scholars who spread wisdom and knowledge rather than becoming scholars of evil, so that they could become a united people who spread the teachings of the Holy Prophet Muhammad<sup>(sa)</sup> in the world, and join with the True Servant of the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> in order to spread the true teachings of peace and harmony to the world.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this in itself is a vast topic. However, at this moment in time, I shall speak about the establishment of peace in the world in light of the teachings of the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> and the <em>shariah</em> [Islamic law] which was revealed to him in relation to peace and harmony.</p>
<p>The teachings and exemplary character of the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> are so vast that they cannot be covered in a short amount of time. Nonetheless, as I have stated, I will mention a few aspects in this regard.</p>
<p>It is claimed that the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, God forbid, blasphemes and insults the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> and that we teach others to do so too. But the truth is that we are the true followers of the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> and we are his true lovers. The literature of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a testament to this. Each year, thousands of fortunate people witness these teachings and our love [for the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup>] and enter the fold of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Even the non-Muslims are left with no choice but to admit that the teaching of Islam is extremely impressive and is one that spreads love and peace and this teaching alone is the solution for establishing world peace today.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, I presented a report on the progress of the [Ahmadiyya Muslim] Community during the Jalsa Salana [annual gathering] UK. In this I also presented the sentiments of the people in respect to the Jalsa, highlighting how people were impacted by being in the company of Ahmadis and by the environment of the Jalsa and how they learned of Islam’s peaceful teachings.</p>
<p>Thus, our opponents may think and do whatever they wish; our responsibility is that if we truly love the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> then we ought to adopt his teachings and spread them in the world. We should tell the world that this is the only solution towards establishing peace and security in the world. So come and attach yourself to the great personage who brought the teachings of peace and harmony and thus procure the means of attaining peace in this life and the next.</p>
<p>These are not just mere claims, in fact, if we take a look through history, we can see how this Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> lead the unlearned and ignorant Arabs from the darkness of ignorance to the heights of high morals, knowledge and conduct.</p>
<p>The Promised Messiah<sup>(as)</sup> states,</p>
<p>“He is the Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> that transformed savages into humans, and then humans into moral humans. In other words, he established them upon the compass of true and lasting morals, and imbued them with godliness and divine colour.” <sup>[3]</sup></p>
<p>Thus, the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> taught all those who follow him and love him the various means to attain morals and worship, which in turn, enabled them to attain the love of Almighty God. And their every word and action was done for the attainment of the pleasure of God Almighty. They fulfilled the rights of humankind with the intention of attaining the nearness of God Almighty. Therefore, by sincerely following the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> with a true heart takes a person to such a stage that they are able to truly love Allah the Almighty. In turn, this true love turns their every word and action into a means of attaining the pleasure of God Almighty.</p>
<p>Regarding those who follow and love the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> with a true heart, the Promised Messiah<sup>(as)</sup> states,</p>
<p>“To obey the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> with a sincere heart and to love him, ultimately makes a person the beloved of God.” <sup>[4]</sup></p>
<p>Thus, this is the revolution that the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> brought about in the hearts of the people, whereby even idolaters became monotheists and such that they ultimately became God Almighty’s beloved ones. They began to love God Almighty and God Almighty manifested His love for them. These very people who loved Allah the Almighty also did justice to His worship in a truly splendid manner. They adhered to the teaching granted to them by Allah the Almighty in an exemplary fashion and established high standards for this. When one loves another, they try to follow every word and action of their beloved; they listen and obey to their beloved’s every word. It is not just a mere verbal proclamation of love.</p>
<p>Thus, when the love for God Almighty developed within them, they also became mindful of fulfilling the rights of His creation and they strove to surpass one another in fulfilling the rights that are due to humankind. When such a state develops, then this instils mutual love and affection purely for the sake of Allah and one fulfils the rights of others for the sake of attaining God Almighty’s pleasure. When such standards are set, then the foundations of peace and tranquillity are also established, efforts are made towards achieving this and the standards [required to achieve this] are also established. The Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> is the one who has shown us the paths to finding God Almighty, and it is only by following the teachings revealed to him that we can establish peace and harmony in the world. Always remember that the foundation of peace begins in the home. Thereafter, its scope increases to your neighbourhood, region, city, country, and then on an international scale. If we are considerate of each other’s feelings and rights at every level, then peace is established. Allah the Almighty has given this teaching in relation to every section of society through the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup>.</p>
<p>Hazrat Musleh Maud<sup>(ra)</sup> [Second Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community] has spoken about this topic on various occasions, but on one particular occasion, he spoke on this subject under the following title: “The Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> and World Peace.” Whilst taking benefit from what Hazrat Musleh Maud<sup>(ra)</sup> imparted to us, I will shall mention a few points.</p>
<p>We see and understand that peace is of great importance. Everyone talks about peace and say it is of great value. It is this state of peace which can ensure peace and harmony at both a domestic and international level. People desire for peace to be established at every level, however a desire alone cannot bring about peace, because even in these instances, their desire for peace is rooted in selfish reasons. This is exactly what we are seeing in the world. If people did not have any selfish desire, the very possibility of wars would be eliminated.</p>
<p>Generally, when someone speaks about peace, that desire for peace pertains to themselves. In fact, in most cases, when a person prays – or even aside from prayers when someone verbally expresses their desire – one usually says that may Allah the Almighty grant peace to them, their wife and children and those close to them. They do not possess the same yearning for others to live peacefully. Or, in order to live a peaceful life, one seeks wealth and thinks it to be good thing, but they do not think of wealth to be good for their enemies, rather they only deems their own wealth to be a source of good. If one deems health to be a good thing, they do not mean that their enemies should also have good health; rather they desire for their enemies to be impoverished and frail so that they may have the upper hand over them. Similarly, if people seek honour and esteem, they do so only for themselves rather than for everyone. They will never desire for others to receive the same honour and esteem which they have received.</p>
<p>This is exactly what we are seeing in the world, both among the general population and among leaders as well. The clashes between politicians and the injustices that they inflict on one another in order to gain power which we are witnessing in our own [Muslim] countries are the result of this very mindset. Hence, if there is merely a desire for peace [for oneself], then it can become the cause of disorder, because it comprises nothing but selfishness. Those who desire peace do so for themselves and those close to them or for their own nation. Otherwise, they wish to destroy the peace of others and their enemies. Hence, if the principle of seeking a certain standard for one’s self and a different standard for others is established, then any peace that is established in the world will be peace for a select few, not world peace. If peace is not for the entire world, then it cannot be considered true peace. True peace can only be established when it is established beyond personal, filial, ancestral, national and patriotic preferences; and in order to establish a central axis. This can only be achieved when one understands and develops the realisation that there is a Greater Being over them, Who desires peace not only for them, but for all nations; Who desires peace not only for their homes and countries, but for all countries. Hence, the focal point of the Holy Prophet’s (sa) teachings about peace is the realisation that there is a Higher Power watching over us, for Whose sake one must align their actions with their words. In order to act upon this principle, we must always bear in mind the golden principle taught by the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> that we must desire for others that which we desire for ourselves.</p>
<p>Hence, we must bear this principle in mind that if we desire peace only for ourselves, our nation or our country, then we will not be the recipients of Allah the Almighty’s help and His pleasure. True peace can only be established when a person becomes firmly established upon the principle that everything must be done for the sake of Allah the Almighty. Hence, Allah the Almighty informed us through the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup>, that:</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"><sup>[5]</sup> ٱلۡمَلِكُ ٱلۡقُدُّوسُ ٱلسَّلَٰمُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُ</p>
<p>He is the Sovereign; He is Pure and purifies others. He is safe from all impurities and safeguards others. He is the Source of Peace for all. By saying this, He has purified the intentions of man.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;">ٱلۡمَلِكُ ٱلۡقُدُّوسُ ٱلسَّلَٰمُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُ</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;">[the Sovereign, the Holy One, the Source of Peace, the Bestower of Security]</p>
<p>Certainly, if one’s intentions are not right, then they can do nothing right. If one’s intentions are not pure, then how can there be any blessings in one’s works? Until one’s intentions are pure, it is not possible to do anything right. All the fighting and disorders in the world today are because people’s intentions are not pure. Whatever people say does not align with their actual desires, likewise, their desires are not in align with their words and actions.</p>
<p>The so-called greater and more developed nations of the world are playing a major role in these disorders.</p>
<p>Although the world deems violence to be wrong; and all leaders proclaim that fighting is wrong, yet what they actually mean is that it is wrong for anyone to fight against them. However, if they are the one’s initiating wars, then there is nothing wrong with that. The reason for this flaw is because of the fact that their eyes are not fixated on the Being Who is <em>Salam</em> [The Source of Peace] and bestows peace upon others. They think that they should raise slogans of peace so long as it is in their interest. However, if there is anything contrary to their own benefit, then they will reject peace. They think that it is never acceptable that anyone should dare provide weapons to their enemies. But if they themselves provide weapons to their alliances, even when it is being used to commit injustices, it becomes legitimate. If this is the mentality, then how can true peace be established?</p>
<p>And so to establish true peace in the world the following creed must be adopted, which is that there is One God Who wishes for all peoples to live in peace. When a person holds this belief and acts accordingly then their desires will be freed of selfishness, and in fact will wish to extend goodness to all humanity. By doing this, our mentality towards establishing peace and harmony will reach a far higher standard altogether. Instead of only considering whether something has benefit for only ourselves, we will think how it will affect the entire world. Worldly people always destroy the peace of others for their own benefit. However, those who believe that there is a Higher Being will never dare to act in this manner, for they are aware that should they do so, the Higher Being would send His wrath upon them. In short, it is impossible to establish true peace until one establishes belief in the Supreme Being and develops His love in their hearts. This belief that Allah the Almighty is the Bestower of peace has only been presented by Islam through the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup>. The teaching which Allah the Almighty revealed to the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> states,</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;"> قَدۡ جَآءَكُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ نُورٞ وَكِتَٰبٞ مُّبِينٞ * يَهۡدِي بِهِ ٱللَّهُ مَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ رِضۡوَٰنَهُۥ سُبُلَ ٱلسَّلَٰمِ</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">…there has come to you indeed from Allah a Light and a clear Book. Thereby does Allah guide those who seek His pleasure on the paths of peace. <sup>[6]</sup></p>
<p>Thus, Allah the Almighty has sent the Light of Guidance, a Book containing all the commandments and which consists of clear guidance that leads to peace. Now, only those who follow it completely will attain the paths of peace. It is evident that the manner in which Muslims today are in a state of disorder, strife and internal conflict is because they are not properly following the Book and Light sent by Allah the Almighty. Whilst they claim they are devoted to the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup>, their actions stand in contrast to this. The words of Allah can never be wrong and the statements of the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> can never be incorrect. The reason for the discord and disharmony amongst Muslims is because whilst they claim to follow this Clear Book, they do not follow the teachings Allah the Almighty has revealed within it. They claim to love the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup>, but they fail to act on his example and his teachings.</p>
<p>Thus, today it is the responsibility of the followers of the True Servant of the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> to embrace these teachings in their lives and act upon the commands of the Holy Qur’an. It is through this that you will be able to foster an atmosphere of peace in your environment and spread this message of peace to the world. If not, people in the world will say that you should first practice what you preach before advising us. The Promised Messiah<sup>(as)</sup> says,</p>
<p>“Now under heaven there is only one Prophet and only one Book. Meaning that, Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa [the Chosen One], may peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, who is higher and more exalted than all Prophets, is the most perfect and complete of Messengers, is <em>Khatamul-Anbiya’</em> [the Seal of the Prophets] and <em>Khairul-Wara</em> [the Best of Men], by following whom God Almighty is found, the veils of darkness are lifted, and the signs of true salvation are witnessed in this very life; and [the Book is] the Holy Qur’an, which comprises true and perfect guidance and effectiveness, through which divine knowledge and understanding are obtained and the heart is cleansed of human impurities; and, being delivered from ignorance, heedlessness and doubts, a person arrives at the stage of <em>haqqul-yaqin </em>[true certainty].” <sup>[7]</sup></p>
<p>Thus, Allah the Almighty conferred a great favour upon humanity by sending His light, which as the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> and by sending the Holy Qur’an which is an Illuminating Book, the Source of all Knowledge, a Fountainhead of Guidance and a Message of Peace. What greater misfortune is there if someone fails to benefit from this and remains a prisoner to their self-vested interests, which will ultimately cause their ruin?</p>
<p>If one wants to adorn their life in this world and the next, if one wants to live in peace and harmony, they would have to always keep in view the words which were revealed to the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup>:</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;">يَهۡدِي بِهِ ٱللَّهُ مَنِ ٱتَّبَعَ رِضۡوَٰنَهُۥ سُبُلَ ٱلسَّلَٰمِ</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">[Thereby does Allah guide those who seek His pleasure on the paths of peace.] <sup>[8]</sup></p>
<p>One should always be mindful of this commandment from this Illuminating book’s guidance and one should constantly study this guidance, only then will we be those who tread on the paths of peace. There is no command in this Book which could be the means of destroying the peace of humanity.</p>
<p>Today, it is our task to convey this message Muslims and non-Muslims alike and this alone will be the guarantee for world peace. This was the revolution that the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> brought about in his companions. He practically created such a community that was an embodiment of:</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;">إِذَا خَاطَبَهُمُ ٱلۡجَٰهِلُونَ قَالُواْ سَلَٰمٗا <sup>[9]</sup></p>
<p>That when the ignorant address them, they respond to them with peace. And when we develop such a state within ourselves and within the world, then our present and future will come to witness peace. This is an immense task entrusted to the followers of the Promised Messiah<sup>(as)</sup>, who have to establish peace and harmony in their homes, in their surroundings and in the world. This will only be possible when our hearts are filled with belief in the perfect oneness of Allah and we invite the world to this true unity.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, peace can never be established without establishing perfect belief in the unity of God. I have explained this already. Certainly, one must come to believe in the Higher Power, and that Higher Being is Allah the Almighty and one cannot instil this belief without the belief in the unity of God. If belief in God’s oneness is not formed, then conflict and discord will continue. Conflicts will only end when true brotherhood is formed. When mutual love and affection is established and brotherhood is achieved. Peace can never be established until true brotherhood is instilled into the hearts of people and true brotherhood cannot be formed without belief in the One God. It is not a case of merely believing, rather one has to form a connection with Him. And we have received this teachings as well through the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup>. Allah teaches us in the Holy Qur’an:</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;">ٱلۡحَمۡدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ <sup>[10]</sup></p>
<p>All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all the Worlds, and commanded us to recite this in every prayer, so that a vast scope of brotherhood can permeate the mind of a Muslim. When reciting, “All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all the Worlds” it gives us insight of the providence of Allah the Almighty being all-encompassing in the universe. Reciting these words expands the mind of a person, and they praise God, Who is the Lord of all the Worlds and the Universe. He is the Lord of the Christians, Lord of Hindus, Lord of the Jewish people, and Lord of all people. How can one have hatred towards anyone having read these words? I once explained this point in an event with non-Muslims in the USA. Some reacted by saying that Islam’s teachings in this regard mean that a true Muslim can never harbour spite or malice in their hearts. “Lord of all the Worlds” encompasses everyone and it opens up the largest possible avenues and paths for peace and harmony.</p>
<p>The words:</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;">ٱلۡحَمۡدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ <sup>[11]</sup></p>
<p>[All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all the worlds] signify that if one adopts true belief in the unity of God and always remains occupied in praising the Lord of all the words, then it is not possible for them to harbour any malice towards another people or nation, be it against Christians, Hindus or Jews. It is not possible that, one the one hand, one desires for people to be completely annihilated and, on the other hand, they praise and glorify Allah the Almighty upon seeing them. This is not possible at all. Thus, one who truly believes in the unity of God is the true flag bearer of peace and harmony. If the Muslims understand this fundamental point and lead their lives in accordance to it, they will truly become the peace-loving people of this world. However, for this, it is imperative that they attach themselves to the True Servant of the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup>. It is only then that they will acquire true knowledge and insight. However, this also places a great responsibility upon us as well to continue to assess our conditions. It should not be the case that we recite:</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center" style="text-align: center;">ٱلۡحَمۡدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ</p>
<p class="has-text-align-left">[All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all the worlds] <sup>[12]</sup> merely as a verbal utterance in our prayers and our hearts are completely devoid of understanding its deeper meaning. If one’s heart and mind are devoid of its deeper essence, then we too will become among those who create disorder and strife and we will not be among those who spread peace and harmony or act upon the teaching which was brought to us by the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup>.</p>
<p>Thus, one ought to greatly ponder and deliberate over this and show great concern towards this matter. Today, in order to spread true peace and harmony in the world, it is the duty of every Ahmadi to establish firm faith in the One God. One ought to instil the love of God Almighty in their hearts so that no other love can take its place. In order to adhere to the instructions of God Almighty, one should make the teaching which was revealed to the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup>, i.e. the Holy Qur’an, a part of one’s life. When we elevate our standards to this level in that we make every injunction of the Holy Qur’an and every instruction of the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> a part of our speech and actions, it is only then that we can convey the true message of Islam to the rest of the world. [In such an instance] we shall not only inform them of the means of establishing true peace, but we shall also teach them about it through our actions. And this indeed is the means by which we can establish true peace in the world and prove that the Holy Prophet<sup>(sa)</sup> is the greatest person in establishing world peace. And this is the very means through which we can silence those who raise allegations against Islam.</p>
<p>This task has been entrusted to the community of the Promised Messiah<sup>(as)</sup>. However, if we fail to discharge our responsibilities in this regard right from the domestic level to an international scale, then there is no guarantee of us living in peace and harmony and nor would there be any guarantee for our future progenies, or the world at large to live in peace and harmony. May Allah the Almighty enable us to become a means of leading the world out of darkness and into the light. May Allah the Almighty grant us the ability to render our responsibilities in an excellent manner.</p>
<p>We shall now pray. Pray that may Allah the Almighty enable all the participants to partake of the blessings of this Jalsa and enable each one to become a recipient of the prayers of the Promised Messiah<sup>(as)</sup>. May Allah the Almighty enable peace and harmony to be quickly established in the current circumstances of the world at all levels, so that we can hold our Jalsas on a large scale and with the same grandeur as before and without any kind of worries or concern and may He make the Jalsas a means of quenching our thirst for spirituality and knowledge. May we truly become those who shape their lives in accordance with the teachings of Islam and reap the love and blessings of Allah the Almighty. May Allah the Almighty grant us the ability to do so. Please join me in prayer.</p>
<p>[After the silent prayer]</p>
<p>First listen to the attendance figures of the Jalsa then you can raise slogans. It is reported that the total attendance of the Jalsa is 19,782, with 9,482 women and 10, 300 men. Apart from this, over 40,000 people watched or listened to the proceedings of the Jalsa Salana through other means. You may now continue with the rest of the programme.’</p>
